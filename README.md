# Time Series and Logistic Regression Analysis

This repository contains a detailed statistical analysis of two different datasets using R programming language. The project focuses on:

1. **Time Series Analysis**: Predicting mean wind speed using weather data from 1942 to 2023, with models including Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters, and ARIMA. The dataset was sourced from an Irish weather station, and the analysis aims to identify the best model for accurate forecasting.

2. **Logistic Regression Analysis**: Modeling cardiac health data to predict the presence of cardiac conditions. A logistic regression model was developed and evaluated based on a dataset of 100 participants, analyzing the relationship between variables such as age, weight, and fitness score.

The final models from each analysis were selected based on accuracy metrics, with ARIMA emerging as the optimal model for time series forecasting, and a well-calibrated logistic regression model for predicting cardiac conditions.

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration and refinement of statistical models in both domains.
